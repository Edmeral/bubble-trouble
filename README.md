## Why?

Pick up higher-level problem solving skills and dive deeper into writing functional JavaScript.

## Game Logic

This is an implementation of the retro game Bubble Trouble. The player must shoot the bubbles before they reach the player to complete the level. The bubbles randomly bounce around the screen and split into further bubbles. 

## Approach

Drawing on the canvas, the game loop, and collision detection are all done without any libraries or frameworks. This project will be written in a functional style. It's not purely functional because of the limitations of JavaScript and I/O being inheritently impure. Instead of deep cloning objects and arrays, Immutable persistent data structures library is used.
